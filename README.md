Description:
Developed a Python-based mini-project simulating a restaurant menu system. The program allows users to select items from a predefined menu, calculates the total order cost, and provides a summary bill. This interactive project emphasizes user input validation and basic control flow structures, offering a fun way to practice Python programming.

Learning Outcomes
Python Basics: Strengthened understanding of fundamental Python concepts like dictionaries, conditional statements, and input handling.
User Interaction: Gained hands-on experience designing a user-friendly interaction model.
Error Handling: Learned to implement basic validation to handle edge cases, like unavailable menu items.
Project Structure: Improved the ability to structure small-scale projects for readability and reusability.
This project was a stepping stone for future projects involving advanced user interface designs and data handling capabilities.
